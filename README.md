# Word Clock

I wanted to have such a clock (in hardware), but for the beginning a software version must do :-)
Thanks to [Achal Dave](https://github.com/achalddave/Word-Clock) I did not have to do the whole work, just heavily tweaked his code (multiple languages, new colors, etc.).

Thanks to github, you can also see a [live demo](https://rawgithub.com/cdaller/Word-Clock/master/index.html)!
